First install X11 and Qt5 development packages. In Debian-based systems, they are:

* libx11-dev and libxext-dev (for X11)
* qtbase5-dev and libqt5x11extras5-dev (for Qt5)

Then open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following commands:

	qmake && make
	sudo make install

If your default Qt installation is not Qt5, put the full path of Qt5 qmake in the first command.

Afterward, you could use this command for cleaning the source directory:

	make distclean
