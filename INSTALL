************************************
*   Compilation And Installation   *
************************************

First install build dependencies. In Debian-based systems, they are:

 * g++ >= 5
 * libx11-dev and libxext-dev (for X11)
 * qtbase5-dev and libqt5x11extras5-dev (for Qt5)
 * libqt5svg5-dev (for hard-coded SVG icons)
 * qttools5-dev-tools (for localization)

In Arch-based systems, the required package are:

 * gcc (or gcc-multilib for multilib systems)
 * libx11 and libxext (for X11)
 * qt5-base and qt5-x11extras (for Qt5)
 * qt5-svg (for hard-coded SVG icons)
 * qt5-tools (for localization)

In Red Hat based systems like Fedora:

 * gcc-c++
 * libX11-devel
 * libXext-devel
 * qt5-qtx11extras-devel
 * qt5-qtbase-devel
 * qt5-qtsvg-devel
 * qt5-qttools-devel

And, finally, in OpenSUSE:

 * gcc-c++
 * libX11-devel
 * libXext-devel
 * libqt5-qtx11extras-devel
 * libqt5-qtbase-devel
 * libqt5-qtsvg-devel
 * libqt5-qttools-devel

Then, open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following commands:

	qmake && make
	sudo make install

If your default Qt installation is not Qt5, put the full path of Qt5 qmake in the first command but before that, put the full path of Qt5's "lrelease" binary into 'featherpad/featherpad.pro' (only one place).

Afterward, you could use this command to clean the source directory:

	make distclean

*******************************
*   Compilation without X11   *
*******************************

If, for whatever reason, you do not want the X11 support, you could compile FeatherPad with:

	qmake WITHOUT_X11=YES
	make

The result will have all features except for virtual desktop awareness.

Please also note that FeatherPad works under Wayland and you do not need to disable its X11 support for that.

Compilation on Haiku OS does not require "WITHOUT_X11=YES" either.

**********************************
*   Translation (Localization)   *
**********************************

The file 'featherpad/data/translations/featherpad.ts' can serve as the basis for GUI translation. The translated file should be saved in the same directory as "featherpad_LN.ts", where "LN" is the abbreviation for the target language, like "de", "fr", "ja_JP", etc.

Optionally, also the file 'featherpad/data/help' or only its shortcuts list can be manually translated as "featherpad/data/help_LN". If the help file is translated, it will be shown instead of the English help, although it does not follow the translation standards.

If you have translated FeatherPad's GUI (or its help file) into your language, please make a "Pull Request" (PR) at https://github.com/tsujan/FeatherPad for your work to be merged into FeatherPad!
