*********************
*   Drag-and-Drop   *
*********************

Files can be dragged and dropped into FeatherPad windows.

Also tabs can be dragged from a window and dropped into another window or outside all FeatherPad windows. In the first case, the dropped tab will appear after the previously active tab; in the second case, a new window containing the dropped tab will be created, i.e. the tab will be detached.

************
*   Tabs   *
************

Tabs can be reordered or detached by the mouse.

If there is more that one tab, each one will have a right-click menu for closing its right or left tabs. With more than one tab, it is also possible to detach the active tab by clicking the related item on the File menu or with Ctrl+T.

If a file is opened in a tab, the right-click menu of that tab will also contain two items for copying the name and path of the file.

********************
*   File Opening   *
********************

If there is a FeatherPad window on the current virtual desktop or viewport, so that more than half of its width as well as its height is visible, files will be opened as new tabs in it; otherwise, a new window will be created. Also when the window on the current desktop/viewport has a modal dialog, another window is created.

In this way, FeatherPad is aware of virtual desktops under most Linux desktop environments. However, there may be exceptions (like Enlightenment). 

If a file is opened multiple times, its second (third, ... ) instance will be uneditable by default and will have a light yellow or dark red background, depending on whether the default or the dark color scheme is used. To make it editable, click on the newly created 'Edit' button on the toolbar or the 'Edit' menu. After that, these two buttons will disappear again.

*******************************************
*   Encodings and Programming Languages   *
*******************************************

FeatherPad tries to guess encodings as well as programming languages (for syntax highlighting) when opening files. Although it often guesses encodings right, there is no exact way for that. Therefore, there are some encodings in the Options menu. If you choose one, the text could be saved with it by using the item "Save with Encoding" on the File menu. By default, all texts are saved with UTF-8.

*******************************
*   Searching and Replacing   *
*******************************

To remove the yellow highlights after finishing a search, you could

* Click on the 'Clear' icon of the search entry, or
* Press Ctrl+K while the search entry has focus, or
* Empty the search entry and press Enter or F3 in it, or
* Hide the search bar.

The 'Replace' docked window respects the settings for 'Match Case' and 'Whole Word' on the search bar. It can be detached from and reattached to the the main window at top or bottom. To remove the green highlights after replacing text, you could either hide/close the 'Replace' docked window or do as in the case of removing yellow search highlights (without closing the dock).

***********************
*   Going to A Line   *
***********************

The Jump bar can be shown by clicking its item on the toolbar or the Search menu. Jumping will happen after pressing Enter while the Jump spinbox is active. If the checkbox beside it is checked, all the text between the text cursor and the target line will be selected.

******************
*   Status Bar   *
******************

The status bar shows some information about the opened file and can be toggled with the item "Document Properties" on the File menu. You could also make it visible permanently in the Preferences dialog, in which case, the above-mentioned menu item will be removed.

*********************************
*   Fast Scrolling with Mouse   *
*********************************

For fast scrolling, put the cursor on the scrollbar. If it is on the text, the scrolling speed will be normal.
